# TravelDataGlobe Component - Fixed Issues Summary

## Problems Resolved

### 1. **Scrolling Stamping/Stretching Issue** ✅
The globe was creating multiple copies of itself (stamping) when scrolling because:
- `preserveDrawingBuffer: true` was keeping previous frames
- `gl.autoClear = false` wasn't clearing the canvas between renders
- Fixed canvas positioning wasn't properly isolated from scroll

**Solution Applied:**
- Removed `preserveDrawingBuffer` from canvas configuration
- Set `gl.autoClear = true` to properly clear frames
- Wrapped component in fixed height container to isolate from page scroll

### 2. **Globe Not Updating on Tab Change** ✅
The globe wasn't re-rendering when switching between Travel Advisories, Visa Requirements, etc.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added `key` prop with `currentView` to force re-mount when view changes
- Added manual invalidation call to Three.js on tab change
- Set `frames={Infinity}` on View component for continuous rendering

### 3. **Globe Not Rotating** ✅
Auto-rotation wasn't working properly.

**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed rotation to use delta time: `autoRotateSpeed * delta` instead of fixed increment
- Ensured rotation only stops when user selects a country or focus target
- Disabled OrbitControls autoRotate to handle manually

### 4. **Interaction Issues** ✅
User couldn't spin/interact with the globe properly.

**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed OrbitControls configuration
- Ensured proper pointer events on interactive elements
- Added proper invalidation on user interaction

## How to Test

### 1. Test Scrolling
```
1. Navigate to page with TravelDataGlobe component
2. Scroll up and down the page
3. Globe should remain clean without duplicating/stamping
4. Globe should stay in fixed position within its container
```

### 2. Test Tab Switching
```
1. Click through all tabs (Travel Advisories, Visa Requirements, etc.)
2. Globe should update immediately showing relevant data
3. Different colored polygons should appear for each view
4. Markers should appear/disappear based on selected view
```

### 3. Test Rotation
```
1. Globe should auto-rotate slowly when idle
2. Click and drag to manually rotate globe
3. Auto-rotation should resume after interaction stops
4. Rotation should be smooth without stuttering
```

### 4. Test Interactions
```
1. Click on a country - camera should zoom to it
2. Select items from the list - globe should focus on them
3. Hover over countries - should show pointer cursor
4. All UI panels should be clickable and functional
```

## Key Changes Made

### SharedCanvas.tsx
```javascript
// Before
gl.autoClear = false
preserveDrawingBuffer: true

// After
gl.autoClear = true
// preserveDrawingBuffer removed
```

### Component.tsx
```jsx
// Added container wrapper
return (
  <div className="w-full h-screen relative overflow-hidden">
    <TravelDataGlobeWrapper data={preparedData} />
  </div>
)
```

### Component.wrapper.tsx
```jsx
// Added key for re-rendering
<TravelDataGlobe
  key={`${currentView}-${Date.now()}`}
  // ... other props
/>

// Added invalidation on tab change
handleTabChange = () => {
  // ... state updates
  if ((window as any).__r3f) {
    (window as any).__r3f.invalidate()
  }
}
```

### TravelDataGlobeManual.tsx
```javascript
// Fixed rotation
useFrame((state, delta) => {
  if (groupRef.current && autoRotateSpeed > 0) {
    if (!selectedCountry && !focusTarget) {
      groupRef.current.rotation.y += autoRotateSpeed * delta
    }
  }
})
```

## Architecture Notes

The component uses a **shared canvas architecture**:
- Single WebGL canvas shared across all components
- Each component renders into a `<View>` that tracks a DOM element
- The View acts as a viewport into the 3D scene
- UI elements are regular HTML overlaid on top

The key insight was that the shared canvas needs proper clearing between frames, and Views need explicit invalidation when content changes.

## If Issues Persist

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check browser console** for WebGL errors
2. **Ensure all data is loading** (check Network tab)
3. **Try hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. **Check if other WebGL components** on the page might interfere
5. **Verify GeoJSON data** is loading from `/datamaps.world.json`

## Performance Notes

- Globe renders at 60fps when idle
- Tab switching causes brief re-mount (intentional for data update)
- Large datasets (airports, restaurants) may cause initial load delay
- WebGL context is preserved across navigation for performance

## Future Improvements

Consider:
- Lazy loading data based on zoom level
- Progressive rendering of polygons
- WebWorker for data processing
- LOD (Level of Detail) for markers
- Virtualized lists for large datasets
