# Travel Data Globe Block Fixes Applied

## Date: January 2025

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Globe Stamping/Stretching on Scroll**
   - **Problem**: Globe was duplicating/stamping itself when scrolling due to `preserveDrawingBuffer: true` and `gl.autoClear = false`
   - **Solution**: 
     - Removed `preserveDrawingBuffer: true` from Canvas GL settings
     - Changed `gl.autoClear` from `false` to `true` to allow proper frame clearing
     - Changed canvas position from `fixed` to `absolute` inside the SharedCanvas component

2. **Globe Not Updating When Changing Tabs**
   - **Problem**: Globe wasn't re-rendering when switching between views (Travel Advisories, Visa Requirements, etc.)
   - **Solution**: 
     - Added `key={`${currentView}-${Date.now()}`}` prop to TravelDataGlobe component to force re-mount on view change
     - Added `frames={Infinity}` to View component to ensure continuous rendering

3. **Globe Not Rotating**
   - **Problem**: Auto-rotation wasn't working properly
   - **Solution**: 
     - Fixed rotation calculation to use `delta` time properly: `groupRef.current.rotation.y += autoRotateSpeed * delta`
     - Set `autoRotate={false}` on OrbitControls to handle rotation manually

4. **Container Structure Issues**
   - **Problem**: Component wasn't properly contained, causing scroll and sizing issues
   - **Solution**: 
     - Wrapped the entire component in a fixed height container: `<div className="w-full h-screen relative overflow-hidden">`
     - This prevents the block from affecting page scroll

### Files Modified:

1. **src/webgl/components/canvas/SharedCanvas.tsx**
   - Removed `preserveDrawingBuffer: true`
   - Changed `gl.autoClear` to `true`
   - Changed canvas position from `fixed` to `absolute`

2. **src/webgl/components/canvas/PreserveBackgroundRenderer.tsx**
   - Removed manual clearing overrides since Three.js now handles it properly

3. **src/blocks/TravelDataGlobeBlock/Component.tsx**
   - Added fixed height container wrapper around the component

4. **src/blocks/TravelDataGlobeBlock/Component.wrapper.tsx**
   - Added `key` prop to force globe re-render on view change
   - Fixed component structure

5. **src/blocks/_shared/BlockWrapper.tsx**
   - Added `frames={Infinity}` to View for continuous rendering

6. **src/webgl/components/globe/TravelDataGlobe/TravelDataGlobeManual.tsx**
   - Fixed auto-rotation to use delta time properly
   - Adjusted OrbitControls settings

### Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Globe renders without stamping when scrolling
- [ ] Globe updates when switching between tabs
- [ ] Globe auto-rotates smoothly
- [ ] User can interact with globe (click, drag to rotate)
- [ ] Camera animations work when selecting countries
- [ ] Visa arcs display correctly
- [ ] Airport routes display correctly
- [ ] Restaurant and airport markers appear correctly

### Known Limitations:

- The component now uses a fixed `h-screen` container which means it always takes full viewport height
- If you need different sizing, adjust the wrapper div in Component.tsx

### Architecture Notes:

This component uses a shared canvas architecture where:
- The WebGL canvas is shared across all components
- Each block renders into a `<View>` that tracks a DOM element
- The globe is rendered in 3D space within that View
- UI elements are rendered as regular HTML on top

The key to fixing the issues was ensuring proper clearing of the WebGL context and forcing re-renders when the view changes.
